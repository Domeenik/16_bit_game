# 16_bit_game
A small project in which I learned the basics of game development. It was also interesting to create animations. The focus was to keep the performance of each implementation as high as possible. Object-oriented programming was used and a subclass structure allows easy implementation of additional game objects.
## Implemented features
- Player movement
- Random world generation
- Json-config handling
- Light
- Day-night-cycle
- Companian (cat)
- Interactions (turn on/off fireplace)
- Lifebar


## Controls
- Arrows - Movement
- "E" - Interactions
- "P" - Performance mode
- "L" - Light
- "0" - New map generation
- "+" - More life
- "-" - Less life
- "ESC" - Exit game
